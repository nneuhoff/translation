## ABOUT ME

“Language is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.” - Rita Mae Brown

This quote emphasizes the profound link between language and culture – a connection that is central to translation. After all, translation is more than the mere transfer of words or phrases; it requires a deep understanding of language, culture, and text types – and the ability to convey the essence of a text effectively in the target language

During my Bachelor’s in Translation at the University of Leipzig, I gained comprehensive knowledge of translation theory and practice. In addition, my work as a translator and copywriter in marketing has taught me how to effectively target and persuade audiences through language. I am currently expanding my expertise through a Master’s program in Translation and Professional Writing at the University of Brest (France) and offer my services as a freelance translator and copywriter.
